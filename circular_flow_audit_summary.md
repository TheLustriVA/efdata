# Circular Flow Model Audit - Executive Summary
Generated: 2025-06-01

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Core RBA Data Infrastructure**
   - 98,892 records across H and I series tables
   - Coverage from 1959 to 2025
   - 7 of 8 circular flow components mapped to facts table
   - 48,382 fact records ready for analysis

2. **ABS Taxation Spider Success**
   - Fully operational as of today
   - 2,124 taxation records loaded
   - $43.3 billion in total tax revenue captured
   - All government levels covered (Commonwealth, States, Territories)

3. **Database Architecture**
   - Star schema properly implemented
   - Staging → Dimensions → Facts pipeline working
   - Time dimension covers full date range

### ❌ Critical Gaps

1. **Government Spending (G)** - Only 20% coverage
   - Have: Aggregate GFCE in H1 table (1,726 facts)
   - Need: Detailed breakdown by function (COFOG) from ABS GFS
   - Impact: Cannot validate equilibrium equation

2. **Taxation Not in Facts** - 0% mapped
   - Have: 2,124 records in staging
   - Need: ETL pipeline to map T to facts table
   - Impact: Cannot include T in equilibrium calculations

3. **No Interest Rates** - Missing financial dynamics
   - Need: RBA F-series tables (F1, F5, F6, F7)
   - Impact: Cannot model S/I relationship properly

### 🎯 Quick Wins (Can do today)

1. **Map Taxation to Facts** (2 hours)
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO rba_facts.fact_circular_flow
   SELECT staging data with component_key = 6 (T)
   ```

2. **Create Savings View** (30 minutes)
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW calculated_savings AS
   SELECT Y - C as S for each period
   ```

3. **Load Interest Rates** (2 hours)
   - Add F-series to RBA spider
   - Run spider for F1, F5, F6, F7

### 📊 Coverage Metrics

| Component | Have Data | In Facts | Quality | Action Needed |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Y Income | ✅ 16,212 | ✅ 6,706 | 90% | Minor gaps |
| C Consumption | ✅ 31,068 | ✅ 4,980 | 85% | Good |
| S Savings | ✅ Derived | ✅ 14,594 | 80% | Validate calc |
| I Investment | ✅ 26,352 | ✅ 11,956 | 85% | Good |
| G Government | ⚠️ 1,726 | ⚠️ 1,726 | 20% | **CRITICAL** |
| T Taxation | ✅ 2,124 | ❌ 0 | 95% | Map to facts |
| X Exports | ✅ 25,260 | ✅ 4,210 | 90% | Good |
| M Imports | ✅ 25,260 | ✅ 4,210 | 90% | Good |

**Overall System Readiness: 79%**

### 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

#### Today (4-6 hours)
1. Map taxation staging → facts
2. Parse G component from ABS GFS expenditure tables
3. Create equilibrium validation query

#### This Week
1. Build unified circular flow view
2. Add interest rate tables
3. Create monitoring dashboard

#### Next Week
1. Automate monthly updates
2. Add data quality checks
3. Build API endpoints

### 💡 Key Insight

The foundation is solid. With just 1-2 days of work on the G component and T mapping, we'll have a fully functional circular flow model with automatic equilibrium validation. The ABS spider infrastructure makes adding G straightforward - same website, different tables.
