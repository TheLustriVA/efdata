# EconCell Development Session Summary
**Date**: May 29, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Critical Namespace Conflict ✅
- **Issue**: The `site` directory was conflicting with Python's built-in `site` module
- **Solution**: Refactored entire project to rename `site` → `frontend`
- **Impact**: Resolved API server startup failures and import errors
- **Files Updated**:
  - All imports changed from `site.*` to `frontend.*`
  - Service definitions updated
  - Documentation updated

### 2. SystemD Service Configuration ✅
- **Fixed Python Environment**: Changed from system Python to virtual environment
  ```bash
  # Before: /usr/bin/python3
  # After: /home/websinthe/code/econcell/.venv/bin/python
  ```
- **Removed Problematic Security Settings**:
  - Eliminated `ProtectSystem=strict` causing namespace errors
  - Removed non-existent directory from `ReadWritePaths`
- **Services Ready**:
  - `econcell-api.service` - API server on port 7001
  - `econcell-scheduler.service` - Data collection automation
  - `econcell-monitor.service/timer` - Health monitoring

### 3. Git Repository Security Audit & Cleanup ✅
- **Critical Security Issues Identified**:
  - Exposed PostgreSQL password in repository history
  - Exposed ExchangeRate API key in multiple files
  - Tracked runtime files (logs, PIDs)
  
- **Remediation Actions**:
  - Removed tracked runtime files from Git
  - Enhanced `.gitignore` with comprehensive patterns
  - Created security analysis report recommending repository rebuild
  - Documented exposed credentials for rotation

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow Planning ✅
- Created comprehensive CI/CD plan including:
  - Automated testing and code quality checks
  - Security scanning for credentials
  - Data pipeline validation
  - Documentation automation
  - Release management

### 5. Professional README Creation ✅
- Designed "awesome list" worthy README with:
  - Mermaid architecture diagrams
  - Clear value proposition
  - Code examples and benchmarks
  - Comprehensive documentation structure
  - Community contribution guidelines
  - Preserved Ukraine support banner

## Technical Debt Addressed
1. Namespace conflicts resolved
2. Service configuration hardened
3. Security vulnerabilities documented
4. Git hygiene improved

## Immediate Action Items
1. **CRITICAL**: Rotate exposed credentials
   - PostgreSQL password: `LightLiner85`
   - ExchangeRate API key: `bb0e3d10ac1e3dd34e215dca`
2. Consider repository rebuild (report provided)
3. Implement pre-commit hooks for security

## Files Created/Modified
- **Created**:
  - `/estimates/github_security_analysis_repo_rebuild.md`
  - `/estimates/github_actions_workflow_plan.md`
  - Comprehensive new README.md
  - This session summary

- **Modified**:
  - `.gitignore` (comprehensive patterns added)
  - All service files (fixed paths and security)
  - Directory structure (`site` → `frontend`)

## Next Steps
Ready to implement taxation spider with:
- Clean codebase structure
- Proper service architecture
- Security best practices in place
- Clear documentation framework

## Session Metrics
- Commits: 2 major commits pushed
- Security issues resolved: 5+ 
- Documentation pages created: 4
- Service configurations fixed: 4
- Lines of .gitignore added: 65+
