## Specific Recommendations for Improvement

### Enhanced AI Prompting
**Current**: Good strategic direction with appropriate technical detail  
**Improvement**: Consider providing more structured requirements upfront:

```
Recommended Pattern:
1. Context: "We're implementing X component of Y system"
2. Requirements: "Must handle A, B, C cases with D constraints"  
3. Acceptance Criteria: "Success means X records processed with Y validation rules"
4. Edge Cases: "Watch out for Z data format issues we've seen before"
5. Integration Points: "This connects to existing W system via V interface"
```

### Data Structure Communication
**Current**: Relies on AI to discover data structures through exploration  
**Improvement**: Provide example data structures or reference documentation earlier:

```
Example: "ABS files have this structure: [sample], watch for these edge cases: [list]"
```

### Incremental Complexity Management
**Current**: Good at breaking down large problems  
**Improvement**: Consider even more granular milestone definitions for complex features:

```
Instead of: "Implement G component"
Try: "1. Parse expenditure sheets, 2. Validate 10 sample records, 3. Full pipeline, 4. Production run"
```
