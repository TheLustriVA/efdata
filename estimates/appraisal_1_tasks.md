# Things I need based on feedback

- A reminder to branch before specific sections
- Use the suggestion prompt pattern
- Get better practiced at chunking tasks down when prompting (implement g component suggestion)
- Find a guide on broader database structures when dealing with data, eg, staging, dimensions, facts
- Find tools for industry-wide status tracking of tasks
- Ask for unit tests more frequently
- Keep an eye on overall project structure more closely
