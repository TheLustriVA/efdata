# RBA Data Pipeline Audit Report

**Audit Date:** 2025-05-29  
**Database:** econdata @ 192.168.1.184  
**Status:** ⚠️ Partially Operational - Critical Issues Identified

## Executive Summary

The RBA circular flow database infrastructure is properly created but only partially populated. While the staging layer successfully imports CSV data and dimension tables are correctly populated, the ETL process to fact tables has only completed for 1 of 8 circular flow components (Investment). This prevents the analytical views from functioning properly.

## Database Structure Audit

### ✅ Schema Creation - COMPLETE
All required schemas exist:
- `rba_staging` - Raw CSV imports
- `rba_dimensions` - Reference data  
- `rba_facts` - Core measurements
- `rba_analytics` - Views and functions

### ✅ Staging Tables - POPULATED
| Table | Row Count | Date Range | Status |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| h1_gdp_income | 5,404 | 1959-09-30 to 2024-12-31 | ✅ Loaded |
| h2_household_finances | Data present | TBD | ✅ Loaded |
| h3_business_finances | Data present | TBD | ✅ Loaded |
| i1_trade_bop | Data present | TBD | ✅ Loaded |
| d1_financial_aggregates | Data present | TBD | ✅ Loaded |
| d2_lending_credit | Data present | TBD | ✅ Loaded |
| a1_rba_balance_sheet | Data present | TBD | ✅ Loaded |
| i3_exchange_rates | Data present | TBD | ✅ Loaded |
| c1_credit_cards | Data present | TBD | ✅ Loaded |

### ✅ Dimension Tables - COMPLETE
| Dimension | Row Count | Status |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| dim_time | 26,298 | ✅ Populated (1959-2025) |
| dim_circular_flow_component | 8 | ✅ All components defined |
| dim_data_source | 5 | ⚠️ Only 5 of 9 sources defined |
| dim_measurement | 10 | ✅ Common measurements defined |

### ❌ Fact Tables - INCOMPLETE
| Fact Table | Row Count | Status |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| fact_circular_flow | 723 | ⚠️ Only Investment (I) loaded |
| fact_financial_flows | 0 | ❌ Empty |
| fact_component_mapping | 0 | ❌ Empty |

## Component Loading Status

Based on the defined mappings in `pipelines.py`:

| Component | Code | Primary Source | Secondary Sources | Loading Status |
|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Household Income | Y | h1, h2 | - | ❌ Not loaded |
| Consumption | C | h2 | c1 | ❌ Not loaded |
| Savings | S | h2 | d1, d2 | ❌ Not loaded |
| Investment | I | h3 | d1, d2 | ✅ LOADED (723 records) |
| Government Expenditure | G | h1 | a1 | ❌ Not loaded |
| Taxation | T | a1 | - | ❌ Not loaded |
| Exports | X | i1 | i3 | ❌ Not loaded |
| Imports | M | i1 | i3 | ❌ Not loaded |

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Incomplete ETL Processing
**Issue:** Only Investment (I) component from h3-data.csv has been processed to fact tables  
**Impact:** Circular flow balance calculations impossible without all components  
**Root Cause:** ETL process may have failed or been interrupted after processing h3-data.csv

### 2. Missing Data Source Definitions
**Issue:** Only 5 of 9 data sources defined in dim_data_source  
**Impact:** ETL may fail for undefined sources (h2, h3, c1 missing)  
**Required Action:** Insert missing source definitions

### 3. Empty Component Mapping Table
**Issue:** fact_component_mapping is empty  
**Impact:** No traceability of which series map to which components  
**Required Action:** Populate mapping metadata

### 4. No Financial Flows Data
**Issue:** fact_financial_flows is empty  
**Impact:** Cannot analyze S→I transmission or credit channels  
**Required Action:** Implement financial flows ETL

### 5. Price Basis Mismatch Risk
**Issue:** ETL hardcoded to 'Current Prices' but data includes chain volume measures  
**Impact:** May miss real (inflation-adjusted) series  
**Required Action:** Update ETL to handle multiple price bases

## Analytical Views Status

### ❌ v_circular_flow_balance - NOT FUNCTIONAL
- Returns 0 rows due to missing component data
- Requires all 8 components to calculate balance

### ⚠️ v_household_flows - PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL  
- Would only show Investment data currently
- Needs Y, C, S components loaded

### ❌ v_external_sector_flows - NOT FUNCTIONAL
- Requires X, M components loaded

## Recommendations for Immediate Action

### 1. Complete ETL Processing (Priority: HIGH)
```sql
-- Check which files were processed
SELECT DISTINCT series_id, MIN(t.date_value), MAX(t.date_value), COUNT(*)
FROM rba_facts.fact_circular_flow f
JOIN rba_dimensions.dim_time t ON f.time_key = t.time_key
GROUP BY series_id;

-- Re-run ETL for missing components
-- Need to execute the RBA spider with proper error handling
```

### 2. Add Missing Data Sources (Priority: HIGH)
```sql
INSERT INTO rba_dimensions.dim_data_source 
(rba_table_code, csv_filename, table_description, data_category, primary_frequency, update_frequency)
VALUES
('H2', 'h2-data.csv', 'Household Finances', 'National Accounts', 'Quarterly', 'Quarterly with ABS release'),
('H3', 'h3-data.csv', 'Business Finances', 'National Accounts', 'Quarterly', 'Quarterly with ABS release'),
('C1', 'c1-data.csv', 'Credit & Charge Cards', 'Payment Systems', 'Monthly', 'Monthly'),
('C2', 'c2-data.csv', 'Debit Cards', 'Payment Systems', 'Monthly', 'Monthly');
```

### 3. Implement Series-to-Component Mapping (Priority: MEDIUM)
Need to populate fact_component_mapping based on the analysis document to track which RBA series map to which circular flow components.

### 4. Fix ETL Price Basis Logic (Priority: MEDIUM)
Update the ETL to handle both current prices and chain volume measures properly.

### 5. Add Data Quality Monitoring (Priority: LOW)
Implement checks for:
- Circular flow identity balance (S+T+M = I+G+X)
- GDP calculation consistency
- Time series completeness

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Re-run the RBA spider to complete ETL processing
2. **Short-term:** Fix data source definitions and ETL logic
3. **Medium-term:** Implement component mapping metadata
4. **Long-term:** Add external data sources for missing T (taxation) component

## Conclusion

The database infrastructure is well-designed and properly implemented, but the data pipeline has only completed 12.5% of the required ETL processing. The core issue appears to be an incomplete or failed spider run rather than structural problems. With proper ETL execution, the system should provide comprehensive circular flow analysis capabilities.
