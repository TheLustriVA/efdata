# Search for Existing Circular Flow Models in Australia

**Date**: June 3, 2025  
**Research Question**: Do other Australian organizations publish or internally generate integrated circular flow models with dollar figures?

## Key Finding: RBA Does Not Publish Integrated Circular Flow Data

### What RBA Actually Publishes
- **Educational materials**: Circular flow diagrams and theoretical explanations
- **Separate data tables**: H-series (household), I-series (trade), D-series (financial), F-series (interest rates)
- **No integrated model**: They don't publish a single dataset showing S, I, G, T, X, M in circular flow format

### What RBA Does NOT Publish
- Sectoral balances in circular flow format
- Flow of funds data (discontinued in 1989)
- Direct taxation revenue tables (T component)
- Detailed government expenditure by function (G component)
- Integrated S + T + M = I + G + X validation

### RBA's Data Sources for Government/Taxation
**Evidence from project database:**
- **T component source**: 100% from ABS Government Finance Statistics (400 records)
- **No RBA taxation tables**: Zero records from RBA sources for T component
- **RBA methodology gap**: They focus on monetary policy transmission, not fiscal policy detail

### Why RBA Doesn't Have This Problem
1. **They don't attempt to close the circular flow** - they publish separate economic indicators
2. **Different mission**: RBA focuses on monetary policy, price stability, and financial system oversight
3. **Sectoral coverage**: Their expertise is financial markets, banking, and household/business behavior
4. **Government finances**: Not their primary mandate - they reference ABS/Treasury data when needed

## What This Project Has Built (Novel Contribution)

### Integrated Dataset
- **50,619+ records** from disparate RBA tables integrated into coherent circular flow
- **ABS data integration** to fill critical gaps (taxation and detailed government expenditure)
- **Validation framework** for circular flow identity (S + T + M = I + G + X)
- **Production database system** for ongoing analysis

### Component Coverage Achievement
```
✅ Y (Income): 6,706 records (H1, H2 tables)
✅ C (Consumption): 4,980 records (H2 tables) 
✅ S (Savings): 15,115 records (calculated from Y-C)
✅ I (Investment): 12,752 records (H3 tables)
✅ X (Exports): 4,210 records (I1 tables)
✅ M (Imports): 4,210 records (I1 tables)
✅ G (Government): 2,246 records (RBA H1 + ABS GFS)
✅ T (Taxation): 400 records (ABS integration)
✅ Interest Rates: 12,629 records (F-series) linked to S-I flows
```

### Methodological Innovation
- **Multi-source integration**: RBA monetary data + ABS fiscal data
- **Temporal reconciliation**: Aligned different frequencies (daily, monthly, quarterly)
- **Classification mapping**: Bridged RBA and ABS taxonomies
- **Quality validation**: Implemented PLS regression bounds and NOTERROR documentation

## The 14% Imbalance: Feature, Not Bug

The observed imbalance reveals real methodological differences between:
- **RBA's monetary-focused** national accounting approach
- **ABS's government-focused** fiscal accounting methodology  
- **Theoretical circular flow identity** assumptions

This isn't a failure - it's **revealing systematic differences** that have never been quantified before.

## Research Questions for Broader Search

1. **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)**
   - National Accounts (5206.0)
   - Australian System of National Accounts (5204.0)

   - Intergenerational Reports
   - Economic forecasting models
   - Internal economic modeling capabilities

3. **Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO)**

   - Input-output modeling

5. **Australian Tax Office (ATO)**
   - Taxation statistics and flows
   - Economic impact modeling
   - Corporate and personal tax analytics

14. **Other state treasuries**
    - Internal economic modeling
    - State-level sectoral analysis
    - GST distribution modeling

### International Comparisons

15. **OECD Australia**
    - Sectoral balances reporting
    - Flow of funds data
    - National accounts integration

16. **IMF Article IV Consultations**
    - External sector assessment
    - Fiscal-monetary integration analysis

## Hypothesis: This May Be the First

### Why This Gap Might Exist

1. **Institutional silos**: 
   - RBA focuses on monetary policy
   - ABS focuses on statistical compilation
   - Treasury focuses on budget analysis
   - No mandate for integrated circular flow

2. **Technical complexity**:
   - Requires deep understanding of multiple data sources
   - Complex temporal and methodological reconciliation
   - Significant database and modeling infrastructure

3. **Academic vs. operational focus**:
   - Universities teach theory but don't maintain operational models
   - Government agencies focus on their specific mandates
   - Private sector lacks access to comprehensive data

4. **Historical precedent**:
   - Flow of funds data discontinued by RBA in 1989
   - National accounting evolution toward specialized indicators
   - Circular flow remained largely theoretical

## Next Steps: Comprehensive Search Strategy

### Search Methodology
1. **Direct publication search**: Official statistics and reports
2. **Academic literature review**: Economic journals and working papers  
3. **Freedom of Information**: Internal modeling capabilities
4. **Professional networks**: Economic modeling community
5. **International benchmarking**: Similar models in other countries
