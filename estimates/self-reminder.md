# Major tasks I want to take care of

## Structure

- Library-focus: Make sure the repo can be used as a library, or contains a libary, where reusuable code is put in the one place.
- Modular Monitoring: Have swappable monitoring components, with standardised logging. Build FOSS monitoring system based on Grafana etc, but allow for swapping out
- Everything in its place: Scripts, documentation, setup files, code, all placed in appropriate places with the top level cleaned up.
- Ready for expansion: An obvious place to put scripts for policy tests, additional models, and custom data processing, plus a coherent method for integrating them
- Enterprise considerations: Learn and prepare the project for various enterprise environment needs

## Tools

- More unit tests
- A cli/tui for running/monitoring scrapes
- A scraper for grabbing other group's calculations for checking our own
- A visualisation of what has been built and what hasn't
- Workflow scripts for GitHub

## Updates

- Update the README.md when there's something to update it with
